title: Awestruct 0.1.1 Released
---

I've just pushed the 0.1.1 version of the Awestruct gem
to [RubyGems](http://rubygems.org/gems/awestruct).

This release brings about quite a few new extensions 
(see sidebar), plus the ability to base many sites of
the same skin, including pipelines, pages and layouts.
