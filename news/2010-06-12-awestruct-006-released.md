title: Awestruct 0.0.6 Released
---

I've just pushed the 0.0.6 version of the Awestruct gem
to [RubyGems](http://rubygems.org/gems/awestruct).

This includes updates to the baseline Compass, Haml and
Sass used by the tool.

Additionally, it adds support for [Org-Mode](http://orgmode.org/).

Enjoy!
