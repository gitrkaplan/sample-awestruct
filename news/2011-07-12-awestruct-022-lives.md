[Flattr]: /extensions/flattr
[blog post]: http://blog.emmanuelbernard.com/2011/07/awestruct-building-dynamic-static-web-sites/
[v0.2.2]: https://rubygems.org/gems/awestruct/versions/0.2.2

Thanks to recent interest from Torsten Curdt, Emmanuel Bernard and others in the community,
activity around Awestruct has increased as of late.

Emmanuel gives us the [Flattr] extension, plus a really nice [blog post].

Torsten gives us RDiscount for Markdown instead of Bluecloth.  Holler if it breaks your stuff.

Anyhow, check out [v0.2.2].

    gem install awestruct
